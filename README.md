This project was built using the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API.

##Here are a few of the skills showcased on this project:##
* Coding with React functional hooks; ``useState`` and ``useEffect`` are both used in different components on this project. 
* Lifting state up; data is givent to child component for conditional rendering and to keep parent clean.
* *Conditional rendering* is used to only render after the API call has completed, as well as change background color and weather image based on the description of the weather. 
* Using ``fetch`` to make API calls.
* Error handling using ``.catch`` to show users when they have incorrectly entered a zipcode or if the app is experiencing issues.

This was a fun, basic React application to build and it really gave me a good amount of practice with state and accessing the data given to you via an API call. If you've read this far, thanks a lot for checking out my application.
